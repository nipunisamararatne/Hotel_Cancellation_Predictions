# Hotel_Cancellation_Predictions

The dataset used in this project is the Hotel booking demand data on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand). Some exploratory data analysis was 
conducted and 5 classification models were run to predict which bookings would be canceled. The models considered were logistic regression, classification tree, gradient boosting, random forest, and XGBoost.
